%> @section intro Introduction
%>
%> @b SEV is a MATLAB based toolbox for analyzing polysomnography (PSG) based sleep studies.
%>
%> Nocturnal polysomnography (NPSG) based sleep studies are used mostly to determine if a patient?s sleep is disturbed by sleep apnea, leg movements, insomnia, seizures or other abnormalities.  How much sleep is disturbed could explain how tired a person is.
%> During nocturnal polysomnogrpahy, the PSG monitors various physiological parameters and rhythms that can be used to differentiate healthy from abnormal or disordered sleeping (how someone manages to sleep wearing so much equipment remains a mystery to me).  
%> 
%> SEV processes PSG studies stored in .EDF or .REC format.  Two modes of analysis may be used
%> the single study mode and the batch processing mode.
%>
%> @section view Single study mode
%>
%> SEV's graphical interface is heavily used in the single study (<i>view</i>) mode.  In this mode, sleep studies are
%> explored individually.  
%>
%> @section batch Batch processing mode
%>
%> This mode is useful for automating analysis of large sets, or cohorts of collected sleep studies.  
%>
%> See @ref installation for help installing SEV on your computer.
