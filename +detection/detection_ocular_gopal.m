%detect eye movements from an EOG channel based on I.S. Gopal and G.G.
%Haddad's method as proposed in "Automatic detection of eye movements in
%REM sleep using the electrooculogram".  The algorithm uses two rules,
%along with modifications that classify eye movement wave forms (EMW) based
%on two rules that are applied to decision points.  The decision points are
%found at local maxima and minima and the rules check slope and amplitude
%thresholds for classification as EMW or not.  
%
% Step 1: low pass filter to smooth the data - butterworth in paper
% Step 2: obtain decision points from local maxima, minimia, and
% modification of rule 1

%Step 1:  Smooth the data with an averaging filter (MA) - 7 taps
%Step 2:  identify points A and B as as consecutive min/max second
%derivaitave peaks
%Step 3:  If diff of A and B > threshold for amplitude, duration, and slope
%then it is an EM
%
%threshold criteria determined empirically by the authors of this paper as:
%Amplitude > 30 mV
%duration > 0.5 second
%slope > 0.5 mV/second  %data is typically in uV here, so make it

%% 1.  low pass filter and smooth 
% - could also just try wavelet decomposition instead..

% low pass filter

lpf_params.freq_hz = params.low_pass_filter_freq_hz;
lpf_params.samplerate = samplerate;
data = filter.fir_lp(data,lpf_params);

% smooth
smooth_params.order=params.smooth_filter_order;
smooth_params.rms = 0;
data = filter.filter_ma(data,smooth_params);


%% 2. obtain decision points/indices
% the math below causes a single sample delay, which is accounted for by
% the cat(0, ...) statement  (e.g diff([ 1 4 2])) produces [3 -2])
% decision points are combination of local maxima and minima and indices
% where |x(i)|>D and |x(i-1)|<D 
% the second amplitude threshold is from rule 2 modification (ref paper).
d = diff(data); %first order difference 
absData = abs(data);

%this also works, but not as elegant

%rule 1
% dy = diff(data(decision_ind));

%results are logical vectors that should be used as indices into
%decision_ind vector which is a vector of sample indices into the EOG data
%itself.
